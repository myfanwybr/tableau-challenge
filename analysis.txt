In conclusion COVID-19 has had a significant impact on citibike ridership:
-   16% reduction in total trips taken in 2020
- increase in casual users compared to 2019
- change in peak hours from 9am & 6am to gradual increase in use throughout the day peaking at 6pm, suggesting more recreational use of citibike
-reduction in use accross all age groups except 52 year olds who doubled their usage from 25K to 50K trips in 2020

Potential suggestions to increase ridership:
-offer discounts to users during covid-19
-market to people in their 50's
-build more stations in new jersey where the majority of people start and end their trips
